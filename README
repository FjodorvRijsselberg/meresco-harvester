1. Installation
---------------
Installation can be done with python distutils.
    $ python setup.py install

2. Configuration
----------------
Furthermore you will need to configure:
    - apache
    - webcontrolpanel administrator (admin)
    - harvesting (user)

2.1 Apache Configuration
------------------------
    An example apache configuration is given in the example directory. Please
    change it to your needs.

2.1.1 Accessible directories.
----------------------------
    The DocumentRoot of your apache configuration should be writable for the
    web user, e.g. www-data
    The directories specified in the PythonOption logDir and stateDir should
    be readable for the www-data user.
    The file specified in the PythonOption usersfile should be writable by the
    web user. (See 2.2)

2.1.2 SSL Certificate creation
------------------------------
    If you don't have an SSL Certificate for your server you can create your
    own self-signed certificate.
      Create a server key.
        $ openssl genrsa -out server.pem 2096
      Create a certificate. Fill in some information. BEWARE: As Common Name (CN)
      fill in your domainname, e.g. harvester.example.org
        $ openssl req -new -key server.pem -out server.csr
      Now create a self-signed certificate.
        $ openssl x509 -req -days 60 -in server.csr -signkey server.pem -out server.crt

2.2 Webcontrolpanel Configuration
---------------------------------
    The webcontrolpanel has one special user called 'admin', with extra privileges.
    They are documentend at http://meresco.org

    Amongst these privileges is the right to create users. This is all done
    in the webcontrolpanel. The created users are stored in the file specified
    in the apache configuration (PythonOption usersfile)

    Each user has it's own line in this file in the format:
        <username>:<md5sum of password>

    To start using the "Meresco Harvester" you will need to provide it with one
    admin user, a default usersfile is in the example directory. It contains the
    admin user with the password 'admin'.

2.2.1 Changing the admin password
---------------------------------
    To create a password for the user admin you can do:
      $ echo "admin:$(echo -n <yourpassword> | md5sum | awk '{print $1}')" > users.txt

2.3. Harvesting configuration
-----------------------------
    Harvesting is done with the startharvester.sh script which is in the example
    directory.
    The user that will run the startharvester.sh script will need to have
    read/write permissions in the stateDir and logDir specified in the
    apache configuration.
